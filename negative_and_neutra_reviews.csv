This phone works just like any expensive smart android phones out there but with ...,"This phone works just like any expensive smart android phones out there but with a big BUT:1. Its touch screen is not as super sensitive which means I have to poke the screen hard to open an app or type a message. This frustrates me.2. The screen freezes on a regular basis and I have to reboot or power off and on the phone frequently to ""un-freeze"" it.3. It gets hot and just drain the battery even I leave it idle and not in use. Although this has happened only six times or so for the past six months I owned this phone, still, it is annoying and frustrating to have a dead phone when you most need it.4. I constantly check the phone's time zone is correctly set to mountain time (I live in Denver, CO) so my time is correct. For some reason it would switch to eastern time on it's own. This happens when I talk on the phone longer than 30 mins. One time I put it on speaker mode when I was on it and really saw the screen switching on its own to date & time setting display from my phone contact photo display while it was on the calling mode. It was weird. On two occasions I failed to check the time zone and I got screwed up with the local time.5. For the past six months that I have been using this, it notified me of wireless update and I was able to do the updates completely twice. The third time it notified me of wireless update and I clicked ""update"", it gave me a message ""sorry lost or no connection"" even when my wireless signal is full bar and my wifi connection was strong and it got a 100% battery. So I was not really able to do the latest update. This ""sorry lost or no connection"" message has been happening 3 times now every time it notifies me of wireless update and when I attempted to do the update.6. This phone is now acting crazy which drives me nuts. There are times that apps are just popping up after one another even if I did not click on them. I swear! And this is a frequent occurrence. For example this has happened for real: I would click on the FB app to check my fb and it would open up and then suddenly my yahoo mail is opening up on top my fb (which I did not click on it at all), followed by my gmail inbox, pandora and the fitbit apps and then freeze. And I'm like, what the hell I did not do that! Ugh, very frustrating!7. The first thing I said about this phone is that the touch screen is not as super sensitive like the expensive phones (to be specific, I compared it to my old samsung note 3 which was stolen) which frustrates me endlessly. On opposite to that, the back of the phone however is overly sensitive because before I put my phone down, it is always in the ""home screen"" mode but every time, I say, every time I put my phone down, it switches to the apps screen or whatever screen it opens up to once the back of the phone touches a surface when I put it down. So at times when I put my phone in my pocket or purse I would not be aware that an app is running which also cause hotness and drains the battery eventually.All in all, I would say that the way the phone is acting, it is not reliable to me. I needed a phone that functions well and I can rely with it at all times. I guess it's time for me to get a new reliable phone.REVIEW UPDATESo today, a week or so after I put my first review above, I received a notification of a ""wireless update"" (please refer to #5 above which was a problem I had with this phone before) which I pushed my phone to have the update by clicking ""Retry"" twice. Then this phone eventually was able to have the ""latest"" wireless update. The update took a while, about 30 - 50 mins or so. When the update was done, it had a new designed homescreen which by the way I liked. But the problem is, I lost my wireless network connection! Every thing was cool after the update except it will not get a wireless network connection so my phone was in emergency mode. I did some trouble-shooting by rebooting; taking off and putting back the sim card; turning off my wifi and totally powered off the phone and turning it on again. It did not work!. I had to call my mobile provider and asked their help in figuring out what's going on with my phone. Although they don't support the device (they are not using  any BLU devices) they were helpful and tried to trouble-shoot too by resetting my sim card and what not. Now the phone would not read any sim card I put in it. It would say ""NO SIM CARD --EMERGENCY CALLS ONLY"" which is full of BS!!! Now I can't totally use this phone anymore. My advice to BLU phone users, IGNORE any wireless update notification. Although the phone was already crappy before the last update at least it was working. I thought the update will make it better that's why I did it, now it renders the phone useless!!!",2,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Great phone for the price!!!,"This phone works well and does everything I expect/and need in a phone.  The sound is a little on the soft side of things and can sometimes be difficult to hear, but everything else is fine.  The phone isn't as quick or sensitive as some of the name brands like samsung or apple, but for the price I'm ok with that.The one major hang up I've had was getting the phone to connect to my carrier (AT&T) for data and mms messages. Phone calls, regular text messages, and using wifi worked fine but I could not get it to connect to AT&T for data.  I tried a few apn settings, took the phone to an AT&T store, and contacted BLU.  Nothing worked until I tried an APN setting that I found through searching the internet.  So if you have the same connection problems with AT&T, this is the apn settings that worked for me.  I've haven't had a problem since, and its been over a month now.Name: ATT WAPAPN: wap.cingularAPN type: default, mmsProxy: [...]Port: 80Username: Not setPassword: Not setServer: Not setMMSC: [...]MMS proxy: [...]MMS port: 80MCC: 310MNC: 410Authentication Type: Not setAPN protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocol: IPv4Bearer: Unspecified***********************************************************Update, downgrading my rating: after 6 months of use the battery completely died on me.  The screen started to disconnect as well.  It was a great phone untill now.  Based on the duration of the phone, it might have been better to purchase a more expensive phone from abigger company that would have probably lasted 2-3 years or more; the cost per month would have been less.  I have mixed feelings on whether I would buy BLU again or not.  The phone was great while it lasted, but the longevity makes me hesitant.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
"Large Beautiful Screen, But Slow Compared to Competition","My experience with this product has been unique for me because I'm used to having the latest and greatest phone on the market from a major carrier like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, etc. I purchased this phone because I was really trying to save money by using a pay-as-you-go service without losing the ability of having a great phone. It did not quite work out that way for me.First off, let me say that the phone does work. If you click on an app, it will open. However, there is a significant lag compared to other devices with similar specs. And with time the device became even slower and would hold less and less of a charge. All of this happened within only a few months of the purchase. I eventually gave it away.POSITIVES: large display, bright + accurate colors, relatively fast on Wi-Fi, videos play smoothlyNEGATIVES: slower than competitor models, battery loses charge quickly, lags",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Deceptively appealing; DO NOT BOTHER,"Okay, I made sure to wait before writing a review because I thought it was just a new phone that was irritating me.I had to purchase a phone, it had fairly good reviews, and I was on a VERY Limited budget- but since I needed to get a phone, I figured I was buying a mid-range phone (smart) so I wouldn't need to replace it as soon as one that was super cheap.1.  Can't use this phone without headset,2.  HUGE, I thought I could get over the side but unless I'm wearing a suit jacket there isn't a female pocket that can house this phone; meaning if you want to walk around the house with your phone- it doesn't fit in the BUSTIEST bra- you need to walk around with a purse,3.  Updates are clunky- I've had the most problems with this phone,4.  tried to eat up data within the first two days of having it- Never had a phone that constantly tried to update in the background so much, in the day of finding everything to shut off I actually took out my card so I could find everything that was running so it didn't chew through more data,5.  The power button and the volume keys are on the sides- the only part that would be exposed if you magically got it to fit in a pocket... however, if your pocket bumps it, it would shut down your phone.6.  I've had it this phone since April 1, 2015, it is now the 22nd- it now has some sort of glitch where if I try to call someone- it will try to call two other people after I hang up.  There is nothing on the screen and I've never dropped the phone.  So if I'm not paying attention it tries to call two other people... this has been for the past 2 days.  I tried rebooting, nothing.7.  If you hold down the volume key, and the power key at the same time (easily done due to the configuration of keys) it starts a boot configuration key... ... IN JAPANESE.  You can't just hold the power key- it makes you do the same test pattern every time- in Japanese you don't know what the heck it is, but it ends up being Power, volume up, volume down, back, home, window.  You can't break out of it- and you can't take out the battery because it's locked in.  If you have this phone you can hold the Power+Volume Down+Home Key and eventually it will reboot... maybe.  Took me forever to figure that out.I could go on;  I'm stopping myself.  I paid 90 dollars for this phone because I used my Amazon credits to pay for it.  Not Worth It!  The screen is crystal clear- but if I ever drop it, obviously that will be kaput.I have nothing good to say about this phone; it's a product of my budget and desperation that I am stuck with this phone.  I do not have the money to afford better, but I won't be wasting my money on this again.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that it's a bad sign when something comes with headphones out of the box.If you are unfortunate enough to try this phone- invest in a blue tooth headset and HOPE you never lose it or it breaks.",1,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
- Price is great. Cons - Screen not sensitive enough,I have mix feelings about this phone.Pros- Screen is bright.- Price is great.Cons- Screen not sensitive enough. I often have to tap 2 or 3 times. I am using the screen protector but I always use screen protector and never have this problem. Is there a setting?- Battery is average- Case included is ok but the charge port hole needs to be bigger. I have to enlarge it using my x-acto knife to ensure charging.- Need better case but none exist yetProblem- GPS is not that good. Sometime it will lost GPS or 20+ meters off target. I use GPS a lot so this might be a problem for me.  Maybe its Google map... I dont know. I am testing it some more.3.5 Stars,3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
"Destroy Android Lillipop, Bring Back Kitkat","I love that it exists, per the cost of a Samsung Note, plus there isn't a 6-inch dual unlocked SIM phone available. But Oriental languages and shutdowns and Android Lollipop  (don't download) is the most annoying aspects of using this phone.  I love this phone. The feel and organization options of Android Kitkat, but I am returning the product, because the product description on the Amazon states that the operating systems is ""Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (Upgradeable to Kit Kat V4.4)"", not Android Lillipop.  Android Lillipop is the worst operating system known to man.  It does everything it claims it exists to prevent (i.e. slows down apps, randomly shuts off the phone and presents green and blu screens of oriental languages).  Android should have kept Jellybean or KitKat until they released Marshmallow. Amazon needs to work with BLU and Android to (1) accurately present the product description and (2) remove Android Lillipop from all phones on the market or provide a quick a free quality upgrade to Marshmallow.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Blu Studio 6.0 HD Smartphone,"Volume is almost too low to hear your calls even when turned up to the max.  Sometimes a voicemail will show it is from a contact of mine but be from someone I don't even know.  The phone sometimes accidentally dials people and I can't hang up so the call wont stop ringing. (THIS NEVER HAPPENED ON ANY OF MY OTHER PHONES) Very odd phone, I don't like the icons either. The icons are strange and don't really make sense.  Voicemail is kind of weird too.  I am used to a Samsung.  When I drop the phone and crack the screen back to Samsung.",2,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
HUGE Bang for the Buck!!!!,"I'm a fan!  It's really hard to beat the value this phone offers.  I got this phone fully intending it to be a placeholder device while I switched carriers. When I realized that the phone was cheaper than the deductible to replace my iPhone, it just made sense.  Now; however, I must admit that I am really impressed by this device.  The screen is amazing.  On T-Mobile, it's incredibly fast.I'm now even more excited to purchase the LTE version of this phone in the next few weeks.  I will definitely keep this as a backup device, but it has served me especially well as my main phone.The only reason I did not give this phone 5 stars was because there is a little bit of ""glitchiness"" (not a real word but you know what I mean) with how the phone seems to handle certain apps.  It has crashed on my more than once, but the restoration was painless.  I can say that the latest update seems to have helped.  For me personally, the pros far outweigh the cons with this dividend it is more that n worth every single cent.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Didn't last six months,"Got it and unpacked it. Was terribly excited as it is a Walmart best seller and currently now out of stock.Black and glossy and slick. Everything came as promised.FYIFirst pause...no mini sim slot like my BLU Life 8 or my BLU Studio 5.5 SSecond pause...has a fixed battery.  No mention of that in the writeup...wonder why?Tried to power it on and nothing.  I remember reading a review prior where the phone came with discharged battery.Plugged in the cable, no lights come on. waited an hour, nothing. Tried another charger, waited another hour, still nothing.Unplugged the device and tried to turn it on, yet nothing.So I plugged it in again and started to prepare to return it, as it seemed faulty.Decided to write a review but got distracted for about 2 hours or so.Feeling a bit dejected, especially as they are out of stock..  Back to my Studio 5.5SDecided to unplug the thing and re-box it, in the process I pressed the power button one last time.It lit up :D charging 12%.I turned it back off and will wait until it is fully charged to setup and make an informed review.I'm pleased again.Look for the update in two weeks :)April 30, 2015 (not quite two weeks) but see update below:Been using the unit and the battery reading was glitchy form the start.Would be at 3% and after charging for 15 mins would say fully charged 100%, yup...Anyway that didn't deter me. Phone froze three different times, still no worries.Then the charge started to last progressively less until I was only getting 2+ hours of battery life.On April 3 it died and wouldn't light up when I tried to charge it, tried different chargers, no luck.On April 4 I plugged it in and left it overnight. On April 5 I found the screen had cracked. Yes cracked.Further investigation revealed the battery had swollen. As it's fixed it didn't push off the cover, it went forward towards the screen.I quite enjoyed the phone before all this, the sleek build and great screen quality for the price.never liked the location of the earphone though, not at the top edge of the unit.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Very Happy with the phone when it works,"I have used the phone for almost a month and like the phone very much. Although the phone volume is kind of low, but it is good enough unless you are in a very noisy place. The size and display of the screen are very nice.Update:After a month of usage, I got a replacement from Amazon last December due to a minor issue on the screen. The replacement had been working fine until ten days ago, the screen started to flash. It flashed roughly once every second, all the time, as long as the screen was on. When it flashed, stripes were everywhere on the screen. I tried reboot, factory reset, etc. Nothing helped. I contacted Blu customer service. They didn't provide much help. Luckily, my phone was still returnable because I ordered the replacement during the holiday season. So, I got another replacement last week. Hopefully, this one will not frustrate me. I reduced my rating to 3 stars. If this one will work without an issue for an half year, I will add one more start to my rating.I am very grateful to Amazon customer service. They are amazingly helpful.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Disappointed,"Let me preface this review with saying that I am a BIG fan of the Blu phones!! I treat myself to a new one every year around Black Friday and have never had a problem. The only time I had to buy a new one was when I stepped on mine and broke it accidentally. I never had to replace one because it stopped working on its own. My current phone is the Blu Studio 5.5 and I love it! Bought the 6.0 as an early birthday gift and hated it immediately after starting it up. My phone came with Lollipop installed, and honestly I'm not sure if it's the phone that doesn't work right or the operating system. Lollipop seems little junky. Screen is unresponsive, takes a few times tapping on something for it to recognize. Scrolling is a challenge... Everything feels like it's on a 3 second delay. I tried installing the updates the phone recommended hoping that would fix some issues. It did not. Received the phone today and I'll be returning it tomorrow. The display is nice and phone feels solid. Just isn't functioning the way I would expect a brand new phone to.",2,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Buy if you are looking for screensize,"I have used for a year now. If you are looking just for screen size, then this is a good phone. Otherwise it has a few glitches:1. The volume and power buttons position are such that you might end up pushing the two together. It goes into android boot menu - to make it worse, it is chinese!2. If you are a traveller, airplane mode does not allow wifi!3. Video recording using the camera leads to very low recorded volume - practically zero unless you scream close to its mic at the bottom of the device4. If you are a traveller again, the timezone changes to reflect in the phone is tedious. do multiple airplane mode on/off with ""network provided datetime and timezone"" selected. if you are lucky it will work",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
like within four hours and the phone got very hot,"the battery in the phone does not hold charge. i fully charged the phone prior to first use but when i power up the phone the battery went down very quickly; like within four hours and the phone got very hot. on another day i put the  battery to charge after it went down to red and within seven minutes the battery was fully charged, this is really bad because its a built in battery so its not like you can just replace the battery. without a good holding battery the phone would be useless since it needs the battery power to keep it going. it is also very annoying because you cant run a video or watch a movie online without having on the charger, but apart from this, its a very nice cheap phone for a low budget.does anyone else has this problem with the battery.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
A Few Problems But Would Still Recommend- (Please Read Me),"This is my second week into owning the Blu Studio HD 6.0- (Black 8G). The size, feel & design of the phone is really nice i must give it that a nice screen that pops out at you with very good HD display and brightness adjustments based on your eyes needs ... i am presently running Android Lollipop 5.0 on it  and it seem to be working fine thus far. However i have been having a few problems with the phone note sure if its hardware or software problem or they can be fixed with a systems update.Here are the problems I am presently having:1. The phone volume is very very very low....and when playing music its sounds as thou the speakers are straining to play which resulted in the audio not being Clair. when talking on the phone the call volume is very very low as well despite all the internal systems volumes be at it fullest.2. The notification light on the front of the phone next to the sensor has not work since i have received the phone so i am unable too see if i get a message unless i turn the screen on. (NOT SURE IF THERE IS SOME SETTING I HAVE NOT TURN ON ?)3.Sometimes the battery will be at 12% after a long day of use, when plug in the battery will jump to 80% charge only after being plug in for 5mins (NOT SURE IF THAT'S NORMAL) on other occasions the battery would charge perfect and last the hole day depending on my use..I presently live in Jamaica so I’m a little unsure of what to do if i should send the phone back via shipping as i may have gotten one that has a few factory defects. Maybe you Amazon can help me on what to do.Other than the 3 listed problems stated above the phone works well, maybe Blu Company can fix these problems via a system update not sure..... i would recommend this phone to everyone who's looking a phone on an affordable budget..",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Next!,"This phone gets pretty hot. Doesn't keep charge. It's shows the battery as being charged, but when you're about to use it, it drops down to 1% the dialog box pop up with ""battery low"", a defect that needs to be fit.

Great for the screen But......,"I ordered two of the blu studio 6. 0 phones. One for my husband  and one for myself . I am the business tape with any phone I have.  The phone must be able to keep up with me. Emails, texts, phone calls and etc.  When it comes to my husband,  he is a gamer and the cell phone must be able to keep up with him as well. In one review,  I read that the blu studio 6. 0 was a good phone for games . When he goes to play a game the screen will go black and you have no other choice but to turn the phone off and back on. Not just the games. When he's in a call, the phone will just hang up. For me on the busy side, the keyboard will freeze as if I'm typing too fast! I have to press the screen hard in order to get it to perform a task. The screen will not stay locked when your on a call. Will even press different keys and move apps or change setting on my phone. We love that the blu studio 6. 0 has big screen! In all the phone was good for it's size for my husband and I  but it's just not working for us. :( . Will be sending them back based on the defects with the phone. On another note, I am trying the blu studio 5 HD and it's doing really gooe so far.

Not worth it,"Had issues with this model. This phone had problems running apps, videos and games mostly. These same apps work fine on my cheaper, smaller memory/ram phone. It'd crash and reboot.

GREAT PHONE. except for Customer service,"I love this phone. It was a little big but that's because i didn't choose it my sister did. Anyway, this phone was great until about 6-7 months of using it the mic gave out. So i sent it back to BLU after a terrible customer service experience for a ""new"" one to return in a paper envelope with bubble wrap and with a screen that is not secure and shows light on the seam from the volume rockers down. I am HIGHLY unsatisfied with Blu. If you buy any of their products, please consider getting an AMAZON extended warranty. Their CS is 100 times better. If I were to rate Blu's customer service alone it would get a 1 out of 5.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
four stars downgraded to two,love my studio screen is super clear camera is awesome the battery life is kinda lacking tho the dang lollipop update sux and when I contacted blu about it they want me to. Pay to ship it and pay to have kk4.4 back on it what a crappy update it turned my loved device into a brick as far as I'm concerned and it isn't but a few months old and they want me to pay to have it reprogrammed was thinking of upgrading to a lte version now I'm not so sure that blu products needs my money anymore,2,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
It broke my heart 😜,"Loved it at first, big fancy looking phone. Takes great pictures. Plenty of storage space. I love Google so androids are my go to phones. Only problem after owning it less than two months, I dropped it and the screen cracked some. I thought that's ok I'll just have to use it with a few cracks. When I tried to unlock the phone, the touch wouldn't work! Turns out the screen digitizer and LCD are fused and would need a new set of those all together. Needless to say I bought a cheaper phone instead of paying $145 to get it fixed. That's more than I paid for the phone! Awesome phone but once it cracks 😭 P.S. My hubby also had one and cracked just by sitting on it in his pocket. Crack was barely visible and it stopped working as well.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Sad to say,For the most part this is a good phone. I have had good experiences with BLU in the past but I bought this phone to replace another phone that was also a BLU that had a problem with the screen doing this weird thing ( I can't describe it). I had the last phone a little over a year never dropped it. I bought this phone to replace it and in a little over a month and it's doing the same thing. Sorry to say I'm done with BLU.,1,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
the phone that I received was obviously opened and used ...,"the phone that I received was obviously opened and used by someone else. The phone was not sealed when I got it. I thought I would give it a try anyways. I'm assuming that this phone had been returned prior to me receiving it by another person for being faulty. The headphone jack did not work, you can barely hear anything when you use the speaker and when making or receiving calls, they sound ""muffled"".  Also, the phone keeps turning itself off and on.

Amazon awesome phones not so much,We purchased 2 of these phones. 1 of them has some minor issues. It will occasionally freeze while playing a game and I have to restart it. That's annoying. But the other phone was much worse. It would reboot itself every 5-10 minutes. Even if you were doing nothing. That phone was returned and Amazon was awesome with the return process. We are waiting for another phone to be delivered with hopefully better results.,3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Breaks very easily.,The phone works like a lower priced phone but it did it well.  It doesn't take dropping very easily. If you drop it it will break not matter how you drop it.  Face down it will break. Hit on corner it will break.  Some freezing up. It is unusable right now. Dropped and hit a corner and it shattered. Was and is still usable but can't use the phone for gaming. Calls out and receives calls.,3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Be careful,"Its a decent phone especially for the price. Get a new home launcher for it and its 10 times better. The size is a blessing and a curse. For kindle and movies its great but, just physically handling it is awkward which means you will drop it at some point and when you do the cheap thin screen will shatter like an old plate glass window.Mines dead now but i would buy again if there were more options for cases.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
Research before you buy.,"I had this phone since February 2015, It is now June 2015. First thing i wanna talk about is the size. You can't use it with one hand without risking to drop it. The second thing is that this phone is full of glitches. Battery is good, But the readings on battery life is off. It constantly freezes at time when typing, And the touch sensor is bad.  volume is low your cant hear anything at all even wen you near it, blah. Your experience will vary but this phone can use a lot of work. I mean it was cool while it last. Dropped it three times the screen cracked the third time, good luck.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
"Good For the Price, not for Verizon","Overall I'm very happy with the phone. I have ""the other"" major service provider… the one that starts with an ""A"" and ends with a ""T""…  I didn't want to have to renew my contract for 2 more years so Blu was a good option for me. Before you read on, this phone WILL NOT WORK ON VERIZON!Set up is super easy. Before turning on the phone, charge the phone completely, then install your SIM card, then turn it on. It will automatically set itself up for your provider and be ready to use.Follow the instructions for updating to Android 4.4.2 here…  http://bluproducts.com/index.php/android-software-updates  Super EasyPROS:• Great screen - Netflix looks great, very bright, nice color, games play well too• Excellent battery life• No ""bloatware"" (all that extra software your service provider installs that you can't remove)• SD Card Slot - You can set up the phone to install new apps to the SD as soon as they download• Good sound from tiny speakerCONS:• GPS is slow to lock on when you first start• No notification lights on the front to let you know you have waiting emails, texts, calls, etc..• Lack of accessories, it comes with a case, but good luck trying to buy something different• Call quality is fair, but not great. This phone replaced a dying GS3 that had amazing call qualityIf you need a good phone, off contract, and you can deal without the LED indicator lights, this is a good deal.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
I haven't given it a bad treatment. I use it as any other cellphone,"""You get what you paid for"" . I bought this item on March 23 and I already have issues with the microphone. No one can hear me when I'm calling. It worked perfectly for the first month but now ( 2 months later) it is all damaged. I haven't given it a bad treatment . I use it as any other cellphone , but it has such a bad quality that it also overheats when I open the navigator for more than  5 minutes. I'm so sad because I really liked the screen but I guess I'll have to spend another bunch of money on getting a new phone, but definitely not  this one. I do not recommend this device to anyone expecting good performance and durability.",2,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
"Good, but not Great.  I wanted to like it, but in the end, I can't.","I tried REALLY hard to like this phone, but in the end, it just fell short for me.  I am a power user, though, and I do MUCH more with a phone than most people will ever attempt, and this phone just couldn't keep up.  Is this a GOOD phone?  YES!  It is a VERY GOOD phone, but it just isn't a GREAT phone.1) It does have problems multitasking-- possibly due to only having 1 GB of Ram.  (It rebooted itself more than once when I attempted to do anything else while talking on the phone -- looking up contacts, open a browser, open an app, etc.)2) It's screen is beautiful, but WAY TOO big to only have 4 icon columns in the native launcher.  I tried a number of other launchers including Holo Launcher, Holo Laucher HD, Smart Launcher, Apex Launcher, and Go Launcher, among others.  I was able to make the icon grid a more acceptable 5x5 or 6x6 and reduce the icon and text size appropriately to take advantage of all this screen real estate, but all the launcers  seemed to REALLY slow down the phone, and may have actually contributed to both issue #1 and issue #3.3) The bottom right corner of the phone's touch screen (in Portrait orientation) including the menu/recent app button, was less than responsive.  Keys on the popup keyboard didn't register on the first tap.  Menu/recent app button took many taps or long tap attempts to respond. This was probably a problem with my specific phone, but it may also speak to BLU's quality control.4) There are no slim flip cases available for this phone.  I no that's not a specific problem with the phone, but it is due to the lack of this phone's popularity.  The provided screen protector and case are very good, and the screen protector was very scratch resistant, but it was impossible to apply without bubbles.  Also, there are few after-market screen protectors available for this phone, again, probably due to this phone's lack of popularity.5) Finally, there just seems to be too much bezel above and below this screen for a 2014 phone.  As a tablet, it's ok.  As a phone, its too much, and this is a phone after all.I like this phone, I just don't love it, and because of it's touch screen issues and rebooting problems, I am sending it back.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4

"Nice, but not for me","I bought this phone as I wanted something simple, and without a lot of carrier junk loaded on it.  It was a less expensive choice over a nexus6.  It has a great feel without a case, but with the silicone cover it's bulky, and it's huge and heavy (8.3 oz)I found the lock button hard to find without the cover.  It is flush with the body.  The cover supplied had buttons over the phone buttons making them easier to find.Also, other complaints I read about the back being hard to remove proved true for me also. The notch was hard to find, and the back requires enough effort to remove that I thought I was going to break it.The interface was very different than my samsung s2 for apps, messaging, phone etc.  The Studio 5.5s I bought was more familiar to me and easy to use.I like others had problems with chargers and ear bud plugs. There was some trimming to the cases to get these to seat properly.Even when they looked right, they weren't.Overall they are a really nice phone, and the price is great.  I ended up keeping the 5.5s  as it's a little smaller, lighter and more familiar for me.  There are very few cases or accessories made for these 6.0  most cases are wallet style, or have a kickstand, but no belt clip.I forgot to add the battery is built in, no no switching.  The sim cards and micro sd install easily.",3,"December 16, 2014",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4YJZOQN1V0P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4
