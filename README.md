# Amazon_product_reviews_scrapping
Python script which extracts product reviews, ratings, review link and name

first of all you will have to install all the packages used in the script packages like

bs4, urllib.request, request, lxml, urlopen and etc.

Than you will go the product on amazon website on which you want to get reviews, links or reviews, reviews ratings and tilte and 
will put that link in script and will run it.

It will give you the outpue in csv file.

anyone with little experience of python programming can run the script.
